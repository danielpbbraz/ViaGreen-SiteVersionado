				<p>Carbon Credit is one of the first attempts created to link economic and environmental issues, thus achieving the pillars of sustainable development. 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions can be traded between organizations with reduction targets or between those that want to neutralize their emissions.</p>
            By convention, one (1) ton of <strong>carbon dioxide </strong> (CO<span class="sub">2</span>e) reduced or avoided corresponds to one (1) <strong>carbon credit.</strong></div>
