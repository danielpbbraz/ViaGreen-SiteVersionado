The burning of fossil fuel, intensified after the Industrial Revolution, is responsible for the emission of gases harmful to human health causing serious respiratory diseases and the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHG), which enhance the Greenhouse Effect, causing global warming and unbalanced climate.</p>

			<p data-ani-type="fade-top" data-ani-delay=".2">The issue of climate change has been gaining prominence in international discussions and fighting it is one of the main challenges facing humankind today. The negative impact caused by climate change is a critical factor for business continuity and competitiveness. For large organizations with complex and geographically dispersed value chains, climate risk can drastically affect the business directly and indirectly, either through physical impacts on productive units or through disruptions of logistics chains, for example. For small companies, climate risk may be even more relevant, since the range of solutions, strategies and adaptation measures may be too narrow or too costly.</p>

				<p data-ani-type="fade-top" data-ani-delay=".2">Transport costs will increase with natural disasters and new routes would be sought for disposal of products, disrupting traditional supply chains. The expansion of extreme events can also affect the passage through locking systems and increase the costs of maintaining vessels, cars and trains, thus resulting in longer delays and higher costs.</p>
