			<p data-ani-type="fade-top" data-ani-delay=".2">Via Green Institute perceived this problem and developed an <strong><a href="produtos/calculadora" style="color:#3CC";> exclusive tool </a></strong>capable of measuring the "carbon footprint" (CO<span class="sub">2</span>e) of the entire route traveled by the cargo (door-to-door), regardless of the mode used.</p>

		  <p data-ani-type="fade-top" data-ani-delay=".2">After calculating these emissions, the company performs the corresponding offset <strong><a href="produtos/compensacao" style="color:#3CC";>(carbon neutralization)</a></strong> by supporting environmental projects that generate carbon credits. The choice for ECOFREIGHT can be made by any player in the logistics and transport sector, such as carriers, ship-owners, railway companies, airlines, NVOCC, freight forwarders, logistics companies, customs brokers, among others.</p>
